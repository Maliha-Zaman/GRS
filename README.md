# GRS
Gesture Recognition System (GRS) is a system that detects hand gestures using Google's Mediapipe. It recognizes hand signs and fingers which are stored for learning, simulation, and testing.

## Requirements
- mediapipe 0.8.1
- OpenCV 3.4.2 or Later
- Tensorflow 2.3.0 or Later
- tf-nightly 2.5.0.dev or later (Only when creating a TFLite for an LSTM model)
- scikit-learn 0.23.2 or Later (Only if you want to display the confusion matrix)
- matplotlib 3.3.2 or Later (Only if you want to display the confusion matrix

## About
-Gesture Recognition System (GRS) is a system that detects hand gestures which is used for helping people to learn the gestures used by deaf-mute people to improve communication.
GRS bridges the gap with the deaf-mute community by making communication easier.

-Google MediaPipe's HandLandmark model is a part of the MediaPipe framework, which is developed by Google for building real-time, cross-platform computer vision applications. The HandLandmark model specifically focuses on hand tracking and landmark estimation, enabling the accurate localization of key points on a user's hand in real time.
